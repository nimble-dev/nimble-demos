# Enron

The Enron email dataset has 517401 documents totalling 2.6GB.
We'll start off with a subset.

```{r}
W <- 100  # Number of words.
K <- 10   # Number of topics.
D <- 100  # Number of documents.

code <- nimbleCode({
    word_probs ~ ddirch(alpha[1:W])
    for (k in 1:K) {
        topic_word_probs[k, 1:W] ~ ddirich(all_words[1:W])
    }
    for (d in 1:D) {
        doc_topic_probs[d, 1:K] ~ ddirch(beta[1:K])
        doc_word_probs[d, 1:W] <- doc_topic_probs[d, 1:K] %*% topic_word_probs
        doc_words[d, 1:W] ~ dmultinom(size = doc_length[d], probs = doc_word_probs[d, 1:W])
    }
})
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
